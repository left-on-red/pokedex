# pokedex

This was my final project for my App Development II Class. It's just an iOS Swift app that interfaces with the pokeapi.co web api and retrieves pokemon information and displays them.

I also submitted this to a MobileMakers Competition and it placed 3rd: https://www.unchartedlearning.org/blog/winter-2018-19-screencast-contest-winners-announced-0
